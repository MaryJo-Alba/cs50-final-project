# Lunch Lite

Lunch Lite is a Python-based mobile application designed for all those people who struggle with sticking to a diet due to the fact that they mostly eat on the street.

## Inspiration

Mexico has been ranked for the past five years as the most obese country, both in adults and children. Seeing that gaining weight was a major trend since years prior, myself along with a group of friends decided to get hands down and tackle the problem in any way we could. 

That’s when Pequeños Nutriologos (Little Nutritionist), our non-profit organization, was born.

Since then, we have worked on spreading healthy culture to as many people as possible and with whatever resources we have at hand. We have mostly focused on teaching elementary school students about the power of choosing wisely when eating, but we have now spread onto working class adults. 

And that is how we got to the idea of the Lunch Lite app!
