# Lunch Lite

Lunch Lite is a Python-based mobile application designed for all those people who struggle with sticking to a diet due to the fact that they mostly eat on the street.

## Inspiration

Mexico has been ranked for the past five years as the most obese country, both in adults and children. Seeing that gaining weight was a major trend since years prior, myself along with a group of friends decided to get hands down and tackle the problem in any way we could. 

That’s when Pequeños Nutriologos (Little Nutritionist), our non-profit organization, was born.

Since then, we have worked on spreading healthy culture to as many people as possible and with whatever resources we have at hand. We have mostly focused on teaching elementary school students about the power of choosing wisely when eating, but we have now spread onto working class adults. 

And that is how we got to the idea of the Lunch Lite app! 

## Description 

Most of the working-class adults we interact with face the same situation: they blame their weight problem on not being able to eat healthy on a regular basis. Most of them mention that, because they go out to restaurants frequently, they are unable to stick to diets. Nonetheless, we also go out to restaurants and seem to not have the same problem. 

Our solution?

Simple. Create Lunch Lite, an app where you will find the city’s most popular restaurants, along with our suggestion of healthy options these restaurants already have on their menu.

We’ll let you know what each of our suggestion contains, the calories you’ll be adding onto your daily count, and provide you with any additional tip that may apply for your visit.
